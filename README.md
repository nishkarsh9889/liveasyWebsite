## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Then, install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Build

To build the project, use the provided build script. This script processes the input CSS file using Tailwind and generates the main output CSS file. To optimize runtime performance, the build command includes the `--minify` tag, which minifies the output:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build script can be found in the `package.json` file:

```json
"build": "tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --minify"
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **dist**: Contains the main output files and folders for the website:
    - `index.html`: The main landing page of the website.
    - **industries**: Contains `industries.html` with industry-specific content.
    - **blogs**: Contains `blogs.html` (main landing page for blogs) and 24 individual blog pages. Includes a `blogs.js` script that renders dynamic blog content.
    - **product**: Contains all product-related pages.
