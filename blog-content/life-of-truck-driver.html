                    The traditional way of connecting through phone calls will be fully eliminated By the apps. Apps or vehicles probably have a sleeping system mechanism that would help drivers to have a quality of sleep when they will be covering a long distance.

                <div class="blog-title">1. WHAT DOES THE SURVEY SAY ?</div>
                <div class="blog-content">
                    A survey was conducted in which it was found that more than 53% of the respondent were not satisfied with their profession. and the reasons were low income, harassment from police, RTO inefficiency, corruption, local group misbehavior, unscheduled working hours, and last but not least less time with family and more time with roads. Not only that it was also founded that 9 out of 10 drivers haven’t received any formal training.

                <div class="blog-title">DEATH RATE OF A TRUCK DRIVER HAS INCREASED</div>
                <div class="blog-content">
                    There is also a risk of Life as of 2018 data more than 1.5 lakh deaths on the road were of truck drivers of which 1500+ deaths were of truck and lorry drivers. To earn a good amount they were forced to overload their vehicle which end up having the risk of their life. Drivers are forced to reach their destination even before the time which results in more driving hours and a lack of sleep.

                    They have more risk of life as compared to others. Even the government has setupped up to slow down the deaths of the driver by setting up highway patrolling unit but it hasn’t worked out what was expected. The truck driver job is not only a tough job for drivers but also for their family too. family too suffer because as drivers are away from home for 15 - 20 days their family members are in constant worry whether their loved ones are fine or not whether they have eaten the food or not and many more.

                    In conclusion, technology has changed the way we do business. This is true for all industries, but logistics is no exception. We are now able to do things that were once impossible. For example, we are able to track shipments in real-time, manage inventory and orders more efficiently, and even predict demand. This is just the beginning of what the future holds.
