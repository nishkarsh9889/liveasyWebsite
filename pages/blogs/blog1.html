                    As we are rapidly moving towards digitalization. Most industries are also adapting changes for themselves so that they could easily grow in the era of digitalization. And just like other industries Logistics industry is one of the industry which is also adapting to the little changes which would help them to expand more in the future. But what would the future of the logistics industry look like? Let us take a glimpse of the logistic industry future.

                        As we are rapidly moving towards digitalization. Most industries are also adapting changes for themselves so that they could easily grow in the era of digitalization. And just like other industries Logistics industry is one of the industry which is also adapting to the little changes which would help them to expand more in the future. But what would the future of the logistics industry look like? Let us take a glimpse of the logistic industry future.
                        <br><br>
                        As of now, we only know that the logistic industry has potential but due to an unorganized industry and ill-treatment of drivers, its potential is yet to be achieved.

                    </div>
                    <div class="content-022">
                        The technology has evolved in a great way and some of the technology used will be:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> GPS will evolve more we would probably be able to know the location in 3D form.
                            </li>
                            <li>JIT or Just In Time deliveries, which were accessible to a select few, could become a norm as digital technology makes deliveries, schedule management, route planning, and cargo monitoring all possible in real time. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the future in simple term truck will move through AI or through remote. through AI we would just need to enter the pickup and drop location in the system and then everything will be done by AI we just need to monitor the truck that's it.
                            </li>
                            <li>We could also see the DRONE delivery in the near future but DRONE would probably be used for lightweight goods or for delivery where vehicles cant be reached for example in hilly areas.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        These advances in technology will obviously result in goods being delivered around the corner, to the next town, to the next country, and around the world in a way that is more efficient, quick and cost effective. But, it is not only that.

                    In conclusion, technology has changed the way we do business. This is true for all industries, but logistics is no exception. We are now able to do things that were once impossible. For example, we are able to track shipments in real-time, manage inventory and orders more efficiently, and even predict demand. This is just the beginning of what the future holds.
