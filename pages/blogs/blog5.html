                    FASTag is an electronic toll collection system in India, operated by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). It employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for making toll payments directly from the prepaid or savings account linked to it or directly toll owner. It is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle and enables to drive through toll plazas without stopping for transactions. The tag can be purchased from official Tag issuers or participating Banks and if it is linked to a prepaid account, then recharging or top-up can be as per requirement. The minimum recharge amount is ₹100 and can be done online.

                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;FASTag allows an end-customer to pay the toll without stopping their vehicle at the toll plaza. FASTags, attached to the windscreens of vehicles, use Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) to enable the electronic payment of tolls while the vehicle is in motion
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;When the QR code and tag identification number are read by an RFID antenna in the toll gate canopy, the boom barrier is raised to enable the vehicle to pass through. The color of the FASTag is different for various vehicles. There are black, blue, green, pink, orange, and violet tags. Different vehicles are represented by different colors.

                        That's where New age Startups and Traditionals companies will step in. They will make drivers families with the new age technology which would eventually help them to generate a good source of income through driving. Through technological advancement, there won't be any hassle in RTO. There would be more training for the truck drivers so that they could know the basics of everything.</div>
