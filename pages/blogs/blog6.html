                    The whole crux of a logistics function is to get the goods delivered to the customers at right time, in right place, and in right assortments. And, for everything to knit in properly, processes at each checkpoint shouldn't propagate delays to the next. For years, this has been the nightmare for all the parties involved, and still is unless everyone involved actively exploits the technology available at hand. One such and the most affordable is SIM-based tracking solution.

                    Sim Based Tracking is made to keep track of fleet activities across multiple locations using the location coordinates recorded by the driver's cellular network. Designed to track, locate, and monitor the fleet's daily operations without the use of traditional GPS trackers.Now you can save on installation costs and improve productivity at the same time.

                        IM based LBS (Location based Services) tracking solution utilizes Cell ID technology used by Mobile Network Operator (MNO) to locates a mobile device by identifying the serving Base Transceiver Station (BTS) to which the hand held device is connected. The Mobile Network Operator (MNO) using the known physical locations cells/sector combination with Timing advance (TA) information i.e., calculated through Network Measurement Information; this adds the improved accuracy of location of device connected to the network with no dependency on the hand-held device capabilities. All that information with the help of advance algorithm for real-time location of vehicle plotted on maps for better visibility of cargo for both fleet owners and clients.
